## Description

In this project we reviewed how to create a programming sugggester for the user. This was a very intereactive project as there were many ways the user was able to provide their input and recvieve an output. In my code I utilized many javascript functions and arrays to provide a clear message that the user receivesd once they complete their survey. I used debugger to test this action.
